I have tested golden cross strategy in S&P500 (SPY) using python and backtrader. Also added buy and hold strategy to get the idea of calling strategies from console.

## What is moving average?

A moving averageis a tool used by technical analysts to track the price movements of a security. It plots average prices over a defined period of time, with the moving average typically overlaid onto a candlestick or bar chart. The bars or candlesticks show the price data for each time period.
